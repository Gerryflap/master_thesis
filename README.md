# Master thesis

This repository contain the code used for my master thesis. In the coming month this repo will (hopefully) undergo some more clarification to ensure that the results are relatively easy to reproduce (given capable hardware). I have attempted to keep this repository clean and well-commented, but the large number of different combinations of models/algorithms/datasets/etc. have made the dream of 100% readable and fully-tested code impossible.

### Requirements:
This code works with pytorch 1.4.0. 
It is confirmed to break when a higher version is used due to in-place operation errors.
